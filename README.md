# Echo Log Extension MVP

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

This is my first ever attempt to create a **Chrome Extension**. It is a self-contained script that injects [the `echo` object][echo] into the parent page, before anything else runs. The `manfiest.json` matches a hard-coded set of URLs that are specific to my local development environment. It is clearly an MVP (minimum viable product).
